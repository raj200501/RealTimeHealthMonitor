# RealTimeHealthMonitor

**RealTimeHealthMonitor** is an innovative platform designed to perform real-time monitoring and analytics on health data. It leverages Apple's ecosystem by using Swift for iOS application development, Objective-C for legacy integration, and Python for backend data processing and machine learning. The platform collects, processes, analyzes, and visualizes health trends and insights in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time health data collection from iOS devices
- Advanced analytics and machine learning models
- Interactive and responsive SwiftUI interface
- Scalable and modular architecture
